*** SOLVED How to show window?

    - State "SOLVED" from [2019-04-08 Mon 17:50] \\
      Adding/clarifying above: If you find that SDL_GetError() isn't
      reporting anything and SDL_UpdateWindowSurface() / etc are
      reporting 0 (no errors) then its more than likely that the above
      code will be the fix, particularly on OSX. You would place the
      event polling loop after your video setup/init/and initial draw
      call. The original SDL SDK samples used to include the polling
      but online tutorials typically include this much later in the
      process (handling input) which can cause confusion. â€“ Jonathan

*** SOLVED main thread problem in SBCL

    - State "SOLVED"     from              [2019-04-08 Mon 17:48]

**** SOLUTION II 

     ENVIRONMENTS (SDL2 + SLIME + SBCL + EMACS + MAC)

     The reason why I need my solution is that I don't want to be
     fixed other environments in the specific problem.

****** 1. just modify codes for main thread problem in SBCL.

******* codes
	#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
	(defun main ()
          (bt:interrupt-thread
	    (sb-thread:main-thread)
	    (lambda ()
	      (sdl2:make-this-thread-main ;; why need? if not, not work.
		(lambda ()
	          (sdl-main))))))
	#+END_SRC emacs-lisp

****** 2. play with (main) in REPL :D (examples)

******* codes
	#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
	(ql:quickload :genetics)
	(in-package :genetics)
	(main)
	#+END_SRC emacs-lisp

**** SOLUTION II (googling)

***** reference
      http://www.jonathanfischer.net/quick-notes-cepl-macos/

****** codes in ~/.swank.lisp
       #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       #+sbcl (setf swank:*communication-style* nil)
       #+END_SRC emacs-lisp

****** (sdl2:make-this-thread-main #'main) in REPL

** find way to implement using the referece of cl-sdl2

*** how to find flags of sdl2 in the reference?
